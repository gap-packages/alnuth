abstract: |
    The <span class="pkgname">Alnuth</span> package provides various methods to compute with number fields which are given by a defining polynomial or by generators. Some of the methods provided in this package are written in <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> code. The other part of the methods is imported from the computer algebra system PARI/GP. Hence this package contains some <span class="pkgname">GAP</span> functions and an interface to some functions in the computer algebra system PARI/GP. The main methods included in <span class="pkgname">Alnuth</span> are: creating a number field, computing its maximal order (using PARI/GP), computing its unit group (using PARI/GP) and a presentation of this unit group, computing the elements of a given norm of the number field (using PARI/GP), determining a presentation for a finitely generated multiplicative subgroup (using PARI/GP), and factoring polynomials defined over number fields (using PARI/GP).
