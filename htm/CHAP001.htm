A number field is a finite extension of the field of rational numbers. 
<font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Alnuth</font> provides various methods to compute with number fields
which are given by a defining polynomial or by generators. For background 
on number fields we refer to <a href="biblio.htm#Sta79"><cite>Sta79</cite></a>.
<p>
Some of the methods provided in this package are written in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> code.
The other part of the methods is imported from the Computer Algebra 
System PARI/GP <a href="biblio.htm#PARI2"><cite>PARI2</cite></a>. Hence this package contains some <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font>
functions  and an interface to some functions in the computer algebra
system PARI/GP. Therefore one has to have PARI/GP installed to use the
full functionality of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Alnuth</font>.
<p>
We note that only a very small part of the functions available in PARI/GP
are linked to <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">GAP</font> and PARI/GP provides many more methods for
computations in number fields. 
<p>
The main methods included in <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Alnuth</font> are: creating a number field, 
computing its maximal order (using PARI/GP), computing its unit group (using 
PARI/GP) and a presentation of this unit group, computing the elements of a
given norm of the number field (using PARI/GP), determining a presentation
for a finitely generated multiplicative subgroup (using PARI/GP), and
factoring polynomials defined over number fields (using PARI/GP). For
background on algorithms for number fields we refer to <a href="biblio.htm#Poh93"><cite>Poh93</cite></a>,
<a href="biblio.htm#PZa89"><cite>PZa89</cite></a> and <a href="biblio.htm#Coh93"><cite>Coh93</cite></a>.
<p>
The functions provided by <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Alnuth</font> are introduced in the following
chapter. Then an example application is outlined. In the final chapter
of this manual the installation of the package and configuration of
the interface, including hints on the installation of PARI/GP, are
described.

<h2><a name="SECT001">1.1 Acknowledgements</a></h2>
<p><p>
To begin with we are very grateful for all the feedback by users of
former versions of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Alnuth</font>.
<p>
We thank Bill Allombert who wrote the GP code for the interface to
PARI/GP and who was extremely helpful in the transition from KANT
to PARI/GP.
<p>
For feedback on the development version, including a code patch, we
are much obliged to Max Horn.
<p>
The second author acknowledges the financial support at CAUL within
the projects PTDC/MAT/101993/2008 and ISFL-1-143, financed by FEDER
and FCT, in the development of Version 3 of <font face="Gill Sans,Helvetica,Arial">Alnuth</font>.
